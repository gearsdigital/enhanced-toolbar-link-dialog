## How to use

After you've installed *Enhanced Toolbar Link Dialog* successfully, open a page of your choice and click the link toolbar button. Make sure the toolbar or the link button [isn't switched off](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/textarea#toolbar__disabling-the-toolbar).

After you clicked the link toolbar button, a modal window gets openend which consists two tabs:

The "*External Link*" tab is exactly what you've had before.

Where it gets interesting is the "*Internal Link*" tab. Within this tab you can:

- search for specific pages (by page title)
- paginate through all existing pages (published/unpublished)
- specify where to open the linked document in [KirbyText](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/text/kirbytags)

As soon as you have found your page, you can select and insert it into your document.
