## How to use

After you've installed *Enhanced Toolbar Link Dialog* successfully, open a page of your choice and click the link toolbar button. Make sure the toolbar or the link button [isn't switched off](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/textarea#toolbar__disabling-the-toolbar).

After you clicked the link toolbar button, a modal window gets openend which consists two tabs:

The "*External Link*" tab is exactly what you've had before.

Where it gets interesting is the "*Internal Link*" tab. Within this tab you can:

- search for specific pages (by page title)
- paginate through all existing pages (published/unpublished)
- specify where to open the linked document in [KirbyText](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/text/kirbytags)

As soon as you have found your page, you can select and insert it into your document.

## Configuration

The list item text is created using the [Kirby Query Language](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/query-language) and therefore customizable. It is totally up to you, how the page will appear to your users. You have access to `$page`, `site` and `kirby`.

The default is `{{ page.title }}`.

In order to change the default add `gearsdigital.enhanced-toolbar-link-dialog.link.title` to your `site/config.php`.

### Example
```php
// site/config.php
return [
    'gearsdigital.enhanced-toolbar-link-dialog.link.title' => '### {{ page.title }} ###',
];
```

This will wrap the text in `###` => (`### In the jungle of Sumatra ###`)
